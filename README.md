The project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on various features and characteristics.
By leveraging machine learning techniques, a predictive model is built that can estimate the price of a diamond
given its characteristics. The model utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset containing various
attributes of diamonds and their corresponding prices. The dataset used for this project contains information
about diamonds, including attributes such as carat weight, cut quality, color grade, clarity grade, and other
relevant features. It also includes the corresponding price for each diamond.
